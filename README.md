<h1>Where things are...</h1>
Routing is in routes web.php
Controllers and models are in the app folder

<h1>What im using...</h1>
using npm to build / cache the styles in app.css, and any javascript needed.
"Livewire" to submit forms and also do most of the functionality that JavaScript would do using "Alpine"

Example of alpine looks like x-onclick="somefunction"

to start the laravel server -> php artisan serve
to start the node server -> npm run dev
to build the css -> npm run build
