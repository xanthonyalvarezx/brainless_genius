<h1>Where things are...</h1>
Routing is in routes web.php<br/>
Controllers and models are in the app folder

<h1>What im using...</h1>
using npm to build / cache the styles in app.css, and any javascript needed.<br/>
"Livewire" to submit forms and also do most of the functionality that JavaScript would do using "Alpine"

Example of alpine looks like x-onclick="somefunction"
<ul>
    <li>to start the laravel server -> php artisan serve<li>
    <li>to start the node server -> npm run dev<li>
    <li>to build the css -> npm run build<li>
  
</ul>
